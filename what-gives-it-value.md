# INTRODUCTION:

It is obvious that the world fiat monetary system is collapsing and a new paradigm is necessary to maintain the flow of products to the people. The need of accounting for resources is real and the facilitation of sustainable resources, production and non-coerced employment are necessary. Money should set people free, not bind them from action.

### THE HISTORY OF MONEY (Barter):
In the beginning Barter was the means of exchange for commodities. This is the most basic form of “money” and is what the creation of money should try to match if it wants to eliminate inflation and deflation. Barter makes it clear, that for any “permanent” creation, there can be the creation of a “note” that is exchangeable for it. Since we wish to have a universal monetary system, were the money is exchangeable for anything, it is clear a “note” must be created for the value of the reusable (recyclable) content of a product and that note must be generic. Logic dictates that the “creator” of the product is entitled to the “note” for the product (not a Bank) which they might use to buy other goods others have created and vice verse with their product's recyclable value as collateral to the note(s). --- any other type of system will have an imbalanced between the creation of money (loans now-a-days) and the creation of true wealth (useable resources) thereby resulting in inflation or deflation.

### THE PURPOSE:
A Monetary System should not hinder the ability for labor to produce, and it should have an automatic system that keeps the Money Supply in check with the current Products (physical things possessed) in existence. This insures the free exercise of creative production and minimizes any chance of inflation or deflation of the Money Supply. All “sound” money is backed by something tangible, and “fiat” currency is by nature subject to corruption. For these reasons this Transitional Resource Monetary System (TRMS) is being proposed to the people of the
