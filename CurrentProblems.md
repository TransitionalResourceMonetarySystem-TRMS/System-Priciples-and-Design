05/17/18 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:

## PREFACE
This summary is intended to be the simplest and shortest possible explanation of this system while accurately conveying the main concepts behind the Economic System know as the TRMS, and its logical implementation within the blockchain ecosystems. Such implementation could create a seamless and complete automated global economic system that promotes lower barriers of entry for goods producers and promotes the creation of products with the highest level of recyclable and re-usable materials as possible. The expected long term results of operating an economic system like this is that over time there will be more and more resources and goods in the economy while at the same time the in-pocket money that the average person has as savings (available cash) will keep increasing and all while the currency value will stay STABLE, linked to recyclable commodity quantities and "added value" from labor in the economy. At some point people will have so many things and so many “dollars” that the perceived wealth will be so high that there will no longer be any need to sell anything for profit and we will be able to enter the era of the Resource Based Economy (RBE).

## MODERN MONEY CREATION
Although there have been a few examples of GOLD backed currencies in the modern era (the USA until 1933,1971 and Switzerland until 2000) after the Renaissance European royalty was compelled to expand the money supply beyond their stored gold and coin which brought about the first “Fractional Reserve” institution of money creation. The Rothschilds figured this one out, if the economy grows there needs to be an equivalent growth in the money supply or else the economy grinds to a halt. In fact neither INFLATION nor DEFLATION are desireable, one causes the devaluation of savings, the onther devalues assets, hence one discourages savings and the other discourages purchasing (think droping of RAM or computer prices as an example). The optimal monitary system should hold the value of money stable, so that pepoles savings holds value and business'es can invest with confidence about the future. Looking back at what happened one would have to concluded that the royalty were not to bright and got duped by the Rothschilds and the “Banksters” as the Banksters were allowed the ability to create money by the mere request of a borrower and his signature and run away with the intrest scott free.

Along comes the Colonies and they realized this same concept and created Colonial Script, but this time, instead of the Bankster’s getting to issue it at interest, the Government would spend the new money into the economy for public projects (like roads etc.) at no interest and based on the annual growth rate of the economy. As long as the government was accurate and not abusive of this ability to create money, then this system worked far superior to the Bankster Fractional Reserve system.

Enter blockchain, STEEMIT and Dan Larimer’s gift of putting a twist on the familiar and pushing the boundaries of possibility to new levels. Steemit follows this same concept, saying evidence shows economies grow and therefor a token economy can have some rate of Token Inflation which can responsibly be spent (eg. government) to the block producers and to promote desired behaviors (content creation: Steemit). This was a genius move that is a milestone in the history of cryptocurrencies and blockchain and glimmers at the future of yet unknown possibilities of these crypto ecosystems.

During the creation of the TRMS a re-evaluation of these money creation schemes was conducted and a question was posed:

What is the “Most Fair” method of money creation?
The past showed the Banksters said “I care not who makes the Laws……". And the Colony Governments said “The Government will Create and Decide....” And the USA said Gold and Silver

But really,,,,, if the legitimacy for creating more monetary supply is that there is more goods and resources in the economy, then shouldn’t the people that “add wealth” to the economy be the beneficiaries of the “new money created”? How this would function will be be examined below.

These links are an educational series on the original non-crypto TRMS. They include issues that do not need to be addressed in a “cryptoTRMS” as the cryptoTRMS is a global system and has no concerns about import and export of materials:

## THE PROBLEM WITH CRYPTOCURRENCIES (MONEY COINS, eg. BTC)
We live in a controlled economic system of Fractional Reserve money creation utilizing notes and bonds of personal and National debt (IOU’s) to create bank deposits and circulating Federal Reserve Notes. The beneficiary of this activity is primarily the Federal Reserve and the Bank of International Settlements.

We all recognize that this system is a form of slavery using a Keynesian economic model and is in serious need of change. Along comes Bitcoin and people feel in their hearts that the change is near, but yet we fall into our old habits and instead of rethinking the situation, we do the same old things, uncreative "DigitalGold" or just a plain currency.

“We can’t defeat the existing system; we must build a better one instead” - David McElroy

"Build a New Model That Makes the Existing Model Obsolete" - Buckminster Fuller

So we started using Cryptos like we already used fiat money in the existing inflationary/deflationary monetary system. We speculate and hope for gains and don’t institute new paradigms of lending or backing of the money and we haven't designed any behavioral motivations towards common goals, instead we keep using the current design that promotes only self interest and greed. We have this wonderful seemingly full of limitless possibilities new tool and we go and use it like a hammer, like the least intelligent tool in the box. All one hears is "Lambo" and "To the Moon".

What we need is a whole new economic system where the creation of money goes to the creator of the real wealth (retain-able recyclable content and added value) and not to the bank or some central entity like government. A brand new way of monetary creation that is used to encouraged social benefit and prosperity via stimulating ease of entry into both business and markets for entrepreneurs and intelligent design of products to maximize recycle-ability and reuse-ability. An intelligently designed Economic System that includes all aspects of the economy from Natural Resource extraction and Commodities Exchanges to Design and Recycling, with OpenMarketPlaces to exchange goods freely and arbitration and governance systems for continued smooth operation (Real Estate and Housing and some other topics are not covered in this Executive Summary) with a money backed by physical recyclable content in the economy.
